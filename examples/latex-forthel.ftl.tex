  \section*{Cantor's Theorem}

  Let us prove that every set is strictly smaller than ist powerset.
  This result is known as \textit{Cantor's Theorem}.

  \begin{forthel}
    \begin{theorem}[Cantor]
      Let $x$ be a set.
      There is no surjection from $x$ onto the powerset of $x$.
    \end{theorem}

    \begin{proof}
      Proof by case analysis.

      Case $x$ is empty. Obvious.

      Case $x$ is nonempty.
        Assume the contrary.
        Take a surjection $f$ from $x$ onto the powerset of $x$.

        Define $N = \{ u "in" x : u "is not an element of" f(u) \}$.

        Take an element $u$ of $x$ such that $N = f(u)$.

        Indeed we can show that $N$ is an element of the powerset of $x$.
          Every element of $N$ is an element of $x$.
          Hence $N$ is a subset of $x$.
          Thus $N$ is an element of the powerset of $x$.
        End.

        Then we have a contradiction.
      End.
    \end{proof}
  \end{forthel}
