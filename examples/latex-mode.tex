    [read sets.tex]

    \begin{theorem}[Cantor]
      There is no surjection from $x$ onto the powerset of $x$.
    \end{theorem}

    \begin{proof}[by case analysis]
      \begin{case}[$x$ is empty]
        % This case is trivial.
      \end{case}

      \begin{case}[$x$ is nonempty]
        Assume the contrary. Take a surjection $f$ from $x$ onto the powerset of
        $x$.

        (1) Define $N = \{u "in" x : u "is not an element of" f[u]\}$.

        Take an element $u$ of $x$ such that $N = f[u]$.

        Indeed let us show that $N$ is an element of the powerset of $x$.
          Every element of $N$ is an element of $x$. Hence $N$ is a subset of
          $x$. Thus $N$ is an element of the powerset of $x$.
        QED.

        For all objects $z$ we have ($z$ is an element of $f[u]$ iff $z$ is an
        element of $x$ and $z$ is not an element of $f[u]$) (by 1).
        Contradiction.
      \end{case}
    \end{proof}
