# ForTheL language support in Atom

Adds syntax highlighting to ForTheL in [Atom](https://atom.io/)

ForTheL is a natural formal language for writing mathematical texts which can be
checked with the proof assistant [Naproche](https://github.com/naproche).

This package supports both ForTheL's standard version and its LaTeX integration.


## Usage

To enable syntax highlighting for ForTheL's LaTeX integration, you might have to deactivate all syntax highlighting packages for LaTeX except for [language-latex2e](https://atom.io/packages/language-latex2e) which comes as an dependency of this package.
