# ForTheL language support in Atom

Syntax highlighting for ForTheL in [Atom][1]

ForTheL is a controlled natural language for writing mathematical texts which
can be checked with the proof assistant [Naproche][2]. This package supports
both ForTheL's standard version and its LaTeX integration.

To enable syntax highlighting for ForTheL's LaTeX integration, you might have to
deactivate all syntax highlighting packages for LaTeX except for
[language-latex2e][3] which comes as an dependency of this package.
