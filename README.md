# ForTheL language support in Atom

Adds syntax highlighting to ForTheL in Atom

ForTheL is a natural formal language for writing mathematical texts which can be
checked with the proof assistant ℕaproche. Since 2021 ℕaproche supports
embedding ForTheL into LaTeX.


## Usage

This package supports both ForTheL's standard version and its LaTeX version.

* Syntax highlighting for ForTheL's standard version works out of the box.

* To use syntax highlighting for ForTheL's LaTeX version, you must additionally
  install the package [language-latex2e](https://atom.io/packages/language-latex2e).
  Moreover, you may need to disable all other syntax highlighting packages for
  LaTeX.
